Put your final project proposal here.

##Self-care habit and accomplishments tracker app

In a fully virtual world, habits are hard to keep,
especially given the dramatic shift in our daily 
lifestyles. With so many of us being discouraged
by the world around us and even pushing for change,
we need breaks to refresh. It also can be draining and feel
unproductive, but in a pandemic, it's ok to not be on top of 
everything. But it's important to still boost morale by celebrating
accomplishments, even if they're small. 

For my final project,
I hope to build a encouraging habit tracker app where different
self-care habits can be monitored for frequency and visually
represented in terms of progress and completion
for the user to understand. The app can also send
positive reminders on the UI to gently remind users
to take needed time to unwind or do something that will uplift them. 
The accomplishments can show up as reinforcement for continuing to 
add habits. 

For week 1, I hope to implement the logic to store habits and corresponding 
accomplishments. In week 2, I hope to start the UI, 
building an interface for habit tracking and a separate interface for accomplishment rendering. 
For week 3, I hope to combine these two functionalities into one cohesive app which
can allow the user to select that they completed their habit and be 
encouraged by past accomplishments they achieved. 

If I were to finish early, I would also be interested in handwritten journaling capabilities
so the user can incorporate reflection and a chance to write down whatever they're feeling.
